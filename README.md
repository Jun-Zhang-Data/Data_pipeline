### Description

<sub>This script is for the Rocker data pipeline assignment. It merges the customers data and the visits data to the loans data and loads all the data into one csv file. Inside the csv file, if multiple values of the visits data in the timestamp_visit column, the referer column and the campaigne name column correspond to one loan, these values are merged into one row, seperated with a comma in between.</sub>
